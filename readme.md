## Publishing

This section contains presentations about publication strategies and related FAQs.

- [Publication Strategies and Practices (Mauro Pezz&egrave;](http://example.com)
- FAQ
  - Is it worth my time to publish in workshops?
  - How to balance conference and journal submissions
  - All my ICSE/FSE/ASE papers got rejected. Should I send the work to lesser venues so I don't have a big hole in my CV?
  - Should I target the top 2 conferences or is building a reputation in less high-profile but tight-knit communities acceptable?
  - How much wood does a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck would get tenure? (where wood is papers, and chucking is publishing, and the woodchuck is a junior faculty)
